# Hackers Gifs Gallery Site

Hosted on Cloudflare R2
run `make fetch-config` and then `make upload` to build and upload site to R2

This is a small searchable Gallery website built on [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/).

This website uses gifs generated by https://github.com/wxcafe/hackers_bot/tree/master and is technically a fork of that repo.

So thanks to `wxcafe` and `lindseybieda`

## Hackers Bot

Posts hackers gifs on twitter and mastodon.
You need to register a twitter app and a mastodon app for it to work correctly,
and fill the variables in the hackers_gif.py file. Install dependencies via
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

The gifs are possibly subject to copyright from whoever produced the movie, but
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Thanks to @lindseybieda (https://twitter.com/lindseybieda) for the code needed
to generate the gifs (https://github.com/LindseyB/videos-to-gif)


## Notes
Gifs are not stored along this repo due to Github LFS costs but you can find them [here](https://github.com/wxcafe/hackers_bot/tree/master/gifs).
